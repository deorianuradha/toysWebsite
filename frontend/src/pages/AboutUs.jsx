            Sustainability is becoming increasingly important in the toy industry, 
            and 3D printing offers a promising avenue for creating eco-friendly, 
            biodegradable toys. 
            By utilizing biodegradable materials such as PLA (polylactic acid), 
            derived from renewable resources like corn starch, 
            3D printing can significantly reduce the environmental impact of toy production. 
            These materials break down naturally, minimizing waste and pollution. Moreover, 
            3D printing allows for on-demand production, which reduces the need for mass manufacturing and excess inventory, 
            further contributing to sustainability efforts.

            In the context of Assam, particularly for the Scheduled Tribe (ST) community,
            skill development through 3D printing technology can be transformative. 
            By learning to design and produce culturally significant items like traditional toys and artifacts, 
            the ST community can preserve their heritage while creating new economic opportunities. 
            Our aim to introduce this technology is based on the idea to empower underprivileged artisans to create high-quality products with minimal resources, 
            fostering entrepreneurship and promoting sustainable livelihoods in the region.
